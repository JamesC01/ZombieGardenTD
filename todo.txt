Include easter eggs, or just fun stuff like you'd expect in demo-scene software, or just
older software in-general.

Add shadow below plants and zombies, and maybe projectiles.

Tweak sunflower/sun spawn rates. At the start, they seem good, but once you get about 10 sunflowers,
it gets out of hand. You get way too much sun.
