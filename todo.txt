Include easter eggs, or just fun stuff like you'd expect in demo-scene software, or just
older software in-general.

Make a B section to music, add more transitional elements, and make drums quieter, and make certain
drum parts less busy.

Consider making zombie waves happen based on the number of zombies killed, rather than a time.

Consider making the game infinite, since I don't plan on adding levels.

Consider making a properly float random function (it's not necessary, but I got stuck on it, so it
could be a good challenge.)

After implementing a proper infinite gamemode/score, add a start screen and game over screen.
