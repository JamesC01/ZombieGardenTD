Include easter eggs, or just fun stuff like you'd expect in demo-scene software, or just
older software in-general.

Make a B section to music, add more transitional elements, and make drums quieter, and make certain
drum parts less busy.

Consider making a properly float random function (it's not necessary, but I got stuck on it, so it
could be a good challenge.)

On new game, in a 1 in 5 chance the weather should be rainy. Figure out how to implement some simple rain
particles and play some nice rain sounds (maybe do some sound design with white noise.)

Improve zombie waves

Improve max FPS. Right now it seems like rendering is limiting the frame rate quite a bit, see if you can
figure out why (just for fun.)
