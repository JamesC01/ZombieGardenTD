Include easter eggs, or just fun stuff like you'd expect in demo-scene software, or just
older software in-general. Partially done with right click confetti, but adding some more
could be fun. Maybe some fun things in the menu once that is done.

Make a B section to music, add more transitional elements, and make drums quieter, and make certain
drum parts less busy.

Improve max FPS. Right now it seems like rendering is limiting the frame rate quite a bit, see if you can
figure out why (just for fun.)

Fix the peas not colliding off screen again.

Add hit flash to zombies and maybe plants when they're being eaten.

Add something that indicates a wave is happening.

Consider trying to design more unique sprites. Maybe sketch on paper some ideas first. But try to deviate
a bit from plants vs zombies.

Allow particles to use textures, and make some simple textures like sparkles

Make sound effects for:
    Picking up a sun
    the zombie eating plants
    a gameover sound/fanfare
    a wave start sound/fanfare


Consider adding different fade curves to particles


Figure out why there's sound latency after playing game for a while.

Add a debug menus with things like giving yourself extra sun, or spawning zombies, just think of all
of the things that are tedious for testing, and put them in a menu

Do sun sprite properly.

Consider rotating zombies to make it look like they're walking a bit more

Made the seed hitting the zombies sound more like the real pvz

Fix flickering sprites (caused by sorting at the end of the draw data array).

Add tooltips (main priority is for seedpackets.)

Make specialized pickup sound for shovel

Add a slider UI control for music and SFX volume.

Make zombie heads last a bit further off screen so you can still hear the splat if they land off screen.

Make sunflower spawn sun a bit higher over the flower part of the sprite

Make confetti secret middle click instead of left.

Remove silent starts for sound effects (if there is any.)

Add more credits and an info/about button to main menu

Gives buttons a slimmer look (make the y padding less)

Add version info

Add some interactable stuff in the title screen, maybe some particles.

Rename game "Zombies on your lawn" is actually the name of the plants vs zombies ending theme :( Make sure to search it up first to make
sure the name isn't taken.

VERY IMPORTANT: rename repo to exlude pvz. While the project is inspired by it, I'd rather not include it in the name of the repo.

Add cover images for the readme

IMPORTANT: Find an appropriate license before making the repo public.
