Include easter eggs, or just fun stuff like you'd expect in demo-scene software, or just
older software in-general.

Make a B section to music, add more transitional elements, and make drums quieter, and make certain
drum parts less busy.

On new game, in a 1 in 5 chance the weather should be rainy. Figure out how to implement some simple rain
particles and play some nice rain sounds (maybe do some sound design with white noise.)

Improve max FPS. Right now it seems like rendering is limiting the frame rate quite a bit, see if you can
figure out why (just for fun.)

Make unique rand function only call during waves or when spawn speed is fast.

Maybe Split up update and draw code to allow pausing while still drawing everything. Or maybe just cache the previous
frame in a texture and render that.

Continue tweaking zombie waves/difficulty curve
