Include easter eggs, or just fun stuff like you'd expect in demo-scene software, or just
older software in-general.

Make a B section to music, add more transitional elements, and make drums quieter, and make certain
drum parts less busy.

Consider making a properly float random function (it's not necessary, but I got stuck on it, so it
could be a good challenge.)

On new game, in a 1 in 5 chance the weather should be rainy. Figure out how to implement some simple rain
particles and play some nice rain sounds (maybe do some sound design with white noise.)

Improve max FPS. Right now it seems like rendering is limiting the frame rate quite a bit, see if you can
figure out why (just for fun.)

Make unique rand function only call during waves or when spawn speed is fast.

Split up update and draw code to allow pausing while still drawing everything. Or maybe just cache the previous
frame in a texture and render that.

Continue tweaking zombie waves/difficulty curve

Consider moving some stuff from globals into game

Consider putting sun code into its own function, and also make a generic timer function, similar to TickCooldown,
but for the sun cooldown, and maybe other cooldowns used in the program.

Look through the code and find any global variables that are declared in headers, and see if they actually need
to be global. I think there's a lot of cases where I thought that they did, but in reality, they didn't need to be
at all.
