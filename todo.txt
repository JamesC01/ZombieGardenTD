Include easter eggs, or just fun stuff like you'd expect in demo-scene software, or just
older software in-general.

Add shadow below plants and zombies, and maybe projectiles.

Tweak sunflower/sun spawn rates. At the start, they seem good, but once you get about 10 sunflowers,
it gets out of hand. You get way too much sun.

Make a B section to music, add more transitional elements, and make drums quieter, and make certain
drum parts less busy.

Make zombies groan more often, maybe multiple at the same time.

Consider making zombie waves happen based on the number of zombies killed, rather than a time.

Consider making the game infinite, since I don't plan on adding levels.
