Include easter eggs, or just fun stuff like you'd expect in demo-scene software, or just
older software in-general. Partially done with right click confetti, but adding some more
could be fun. Maybe some fun things in the menu once that is done.

Make a B section to music, add more transitional elements, and make drums quieter, and make certain
drum parts less busy.

Improve max FPS. Right now it seems like rendering is limiting the frame rate quite a bit, see if you can
figure out why (just for fun.)

Fix the peas not colliding off screen again.

Add something that indicates a wave is happening.

Allow particles to use textures, and make some simple textures like sparkles

Make sound effects for:
    Picking up a sun
    the zombie eating plants
    a gameover sound/fanfare
    a wave start sound/fanfare


Consider adding different fade curves to particles

Figure out why there's sound latency after playing game for a while.

Make the seed hitting the zombies sound more like the real pvz

Add tooltips (main priority is for seedpackets.)

Make specialized pickup sound for shovel

Add a slider UI control for music and SFX volume.

Remove silent starts for sound effects (if there is any.)

Add more credits and an info/about button to main menu

Add some interactable stuff in the title screen, maybe some particles.

Consider refactoring menus. There's a lot of similar code in them

Make head x vel randomised, + make head rotation speed random

Make plant being eaten spawn particles and a big exposion when the plant is dead

Make zombie heads leave trailing blood particles once they're on the ground (just need a particle with no velocity)
