Include easter eggs, or just fun stuff like you'd expect in demo-scene software, or just
older software in-general.

Make a B section to music, add more transitional elements, and make drums quieter, and make certain
drum parts less busy.

Consider making zombie waves happen based on the number of zombies killed, rather than a time.

Consider making the game infinite, since I don't plan on adding levels.

Consider making a properly float random function (it's not necessary, but I got stuck on it, so it
could be a good challenge.)

After implementing a proper infinite gamemode/score, add a start screen and game over screen.

On new game, in a 1 in 5 chance the weather should be rainy. Figure out how to implement some simple rain
particles and play some nice rain sounds (maybe do some sound design with white noise.)

Implement a way to game over (zombies reach the left side of screen)

Fix zombies being clustered together during waves
