I've become much more open minded when listening to guys like Casey Muratori, and I feel like I've learned a lot.
The goal of this project is to apply the idea of writing code as simply as possible, without too much planning,
and no premature abstraction. Another goal is to also just enjoy programming. Enjoy lower level C programming.
Also partly to see if I even do enjoy it.

I've spent 3 hours on this project so far (including doing the sprites) and I'm really enjoying it. It feels very
natural, and I'm not doing too much planning, it's just organically growing. I think planning should be a balance.
Planning can be very difficult when there are lots of different things interacting. It's too much to keep in your
head, or even written down, sometimes, so this gung-ho style of programming feels very nice. I like the idea of
just loosely planning something, or thinking about a simple implementation of it, and then just doing it. It feels
right.

I'm definitely doing a bit of planning, but it's mostly in my head. I'm just thinking of the simplest ways of doing
things, and then thinking a *little* bit further about how the thing I'm implementing might interact with the other
things in my game. The mentality I'm going for is one where I plan simple things (either in my head, or write them
down), and just implement them. If they need changing later, then so be it. The truth is, even if I spent an hour
planning, there's still a good chance I'd overlook something, so I think it's good to just get it out of the way
and implement it in a working, but not very abstracted way, and then if I find myself repeating similar code, then
I can think about how to abstract/compress it.

The planning I've been thinking about is stuff like "how will the projectiles hit the zombies?" and "how will the
zombies be able to eat the plants?" When thinking about these types of problems, I find my brains tries to think
of ways of implementing it, which is great. I think the problem arises from when you stay away from programming
completely to solve the problem ahead of time, and try to plan too much for future features. Actually planning
the implementation isn't too bad, but it's when you abstract it before you even need to. Regardless, I still really
like this feeling of not obsessively planning. It feels fun.
