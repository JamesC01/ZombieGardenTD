I've become much more open minded when listening to guys like Casey Muratori, and I feel like I've learned a lot.
The goal of this project is to apply the idea of writing code as simply as possible, without too much planning,
and no premature abstraction. Another goal is to also just enjoy programming. Enjoy lower level C programming.
Also partly to see if I even do enjoy it.
